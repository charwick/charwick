## Hi, I'm Cameron Harwick. I'm an economist.

I do [work on monetary theory, cryptocurrencies, and the evolution of norms and institutions](https://cameronharwick.com/research). The code that supports that research is here: Python for agent-based modeling (check out [Helipad](https://helipad.dev)), and the usual HTML/CSS/JS/PHP/MySQL stack for [my website](https://cameronharwick.com).
